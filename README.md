# Angular Course from rangle.io

This repository contains handout materials and code for rangle.io's AngularJS
training course. This is meant to be used as a part of the course, which is
normally offered as a 2-3 day event. See http://rangle.io/training/ for more
information.

## The Handouts

See the [handout](https://github.com/rangle/ngcourse/tree/master/handout) for
the handout.

## The Code

The repository also contains the codebase that we'll work on in throughout the
course. The project has a server and the client component. The students will
use server code deployed to http://ngcourse.herokuapp.com/ and will develop
the client-side code on their own machines. The students should start by
checking out branch "base", which has all the necessary configurations but no
actual client side code. The "master" branch contains the final state of the
project.

The server code is in
[server](https://github.com/rangle/ngcourse/tree/master/server). The client
code is in [client](https://github.com/rangle/ngcourse/tree/master/client)
