## Google Chrome and Batarang

Please install a recent version of Google Chrome, since we'll be using
tools that assume it.

Once you have installed Chrome, please install Angular Batarang, which is an
Google Chrome extension that makes it easier to debug and inspect Angular
applications. You can get it from the
[Google Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/angularjs-batarang-stable/niopocochgahfkiccpjmmpchncjoapek)
