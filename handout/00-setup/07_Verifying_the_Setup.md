## Verifying the Setup

Once you have all the tools set up correctly, you should be able to do the
following steps through the command line. This is the best way to check that
`git`, `node`, and `npm` were installed correctly.

Clone the training repository:

```sh
  git clone https://github.com/rangle/ngcourse-next.git
  cd ngcourse-next
```

Install the project's `npm` modules:

```sh
  npm install
```

Fire up the development server:

```sh
  npm start
```

Once you've run those commands, you should be able to access the server at
<http://localhost:8080>. If you see a login form at that point, then you did
everything correctly and are ready for the course.
