__Windows Users__: Just select the default options in the installation wizard.

__Windows Users__: The rest of this course assumes you are using the terminal

There are tools that provide a GUI interface for `git`, for both OS X and
Windows. Attendees who are proficient with `git` and prefer to use those tools
can do so if they wish. However, all of our instructions will be for the
command line, so we recommend having this available as a backup.
