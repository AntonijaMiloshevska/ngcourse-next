# MEAN Stack Security Considerations

As our SPA's get more complex, and more business logic, rules, and validation move up to the client side - there are some new security considerations that need to be kept in mind.

However, a common misconception is that just because business rules and security checks have been moved up to the client side, negates the need to reimplement the same considerations on the server side. The old adage:

> Never Trust The Client

Still remains true. While validating data, applying security rules can lead to a more enjoyable user experience on the front-end, it does not negate the need to reinforce these checks on the server side.

The next sections of this course will discuss some steps that can be taken to help secure the front-end of your application, while also talking about some of the considerations that still need to be applied on the back-end.
