# UI Router

Routing allows us to express some aspects of the app's state in the URL.
Unlike with server-side front-end solutions, this is optional - we can build
the full app without ever changing the URL. Adding routing, however, allows
the user to go straight into certain aspects of the app, which can be very
convenient.
