## What is Reactive Programming

Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams represented by Observables. The concept here is a mix of Observer and Iterable design patterns. Specifically, observable can be conceptualized as an immutable collection of data ordered in time, and iterated over similarly to collections such as arrays or lists.
