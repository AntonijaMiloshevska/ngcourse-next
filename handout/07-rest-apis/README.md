# Making HTTP Requests.

Most AngularJS apps will need to interact with a backend system to achieve
their objectives. By far the most common protocol for this is HTTP (or,
preferably, it's secure version, HTTPS). While this is the same protocol that
was employed by the previous generation of web applications, it tends to be
used rather differently in a context of a modern single-page application
framework such as AngularJS.
