# Flux Architecture

Flux is an architectural design pattern introduced and used by Facebook as an alternative to traditional MVC patterns to build modern web applications. Flux is not a library and implementing it within your application can be done without depending on any 3rd part code. Moreover Flux is language and framework agnostic and can be used outside single web-page application and JavaScript context. The cored ideas behind Flux are inspired by game programming, specifically rendering of the changes of your domain model.
