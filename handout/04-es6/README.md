# EcmaScript 6 and TypeScript

The new version of JavaScript, "EcmaScript 6" or "ES6", offers a number of new features that extend the power of the language. (The language we usually call "JavaScript" is actually formally known as "EcmaScript".) ES6 is not widely supported in today's browsers, so it needs to be transpiled to ES5. You can choose between several transpilers, but we'll be using TypeScript, which is what Angular team uses to write Angular 2.
