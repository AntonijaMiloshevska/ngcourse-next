## Additional ES6 Features

In addition to classes and arrow functions, ES6 offers numerous other features not available in ES5. Most of those are currently supported by TypeScript. We won't discuss those features here, though we will come across some of them in the course. We encourage you to learn more about them on your own, however. This repository provides a good overview: [https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features).
