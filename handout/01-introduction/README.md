# Part 1: Introduction to AngularJS and ngCourse-Next

AngularJS is the leading open source JavaScript application framework backed by Google. The "1.x" version of AngularJS has been used quite widely. The new "Angular 2" version of the framework is currently available as a preview.

This course ("ngCourse-Next") provides an introduction to AngularJS based on our experience at [rangle.io](http://rangle.io) and with an eye to eventual transition to Angular 2. In other words, we will be learning how to build single page applications using Angular 1.4, but in such a way as to make the eventual transition to Angular 2 as easy as possible.
