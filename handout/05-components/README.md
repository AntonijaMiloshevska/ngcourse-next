# Getting Started with the Client

This course will be organized around building a collaborative task manager. We will start by building a client app, which we will later connect to a REST API. Our first task is to setup a simple Angular app consisting of a few **components**, and to understand how they fit together. 

We'll be making use of common built-in directives such as `ng-model`, `ng-show`, `ng-hide`, `ng-cloak`, `ng-if`, `ng-repeat`. We will also discuss Angularâ€™s dependency injection and the use of `$log` for logging.
